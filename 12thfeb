a=int(input("Enter the value of A:"))
b=int(input("Enter the value of B:"))
if a==b:
    print("A is Equal to B")
elif a>b:
    print("A is Greater than B")
elif a<b:
    print("B is Greater than A")
else:
    print("A is Not Equal to B")
    
    
Output:-

Enter the value of A:4
Enter the value of B:7
